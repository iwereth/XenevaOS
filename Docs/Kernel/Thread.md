# Threading in XenevaOS
In Xeneva, whole multitasking is built on concept of threads. Xeneva doesn't know what is _process_ or _user application_ instead it only cares about thread which is currently using the cpu resource. In simple language, Thread is a smallest unit of execution in XenevaOS. Entire multi-tasking concept uses threads to do various task. The scheduler is the heart of XenevaOS and its multi-tasking feature. The scheduler is responsible for arranging and executing next threads after previous threads. It does so by creating, blocking-and-unblocking threads (_a.k.a synchronization_) and terminating unwanted threads. <br>
Thread holds a special structure which stores the current cpu state, stack pointer, memory informations, ..etc. <br>
